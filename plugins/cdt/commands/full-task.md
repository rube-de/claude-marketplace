# /full-task — Complete Workflow

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS

Two-phase orchestration: plan team → user approval → dev team. One team per session, so plan team must be fully cleaned up before dev team starts.

```text

```

`[tm]` = teammate (Agent Team)  `[sa]` = subagent

## Step 0: Git Check

1. Run `git fetch origin`
2. Ensure you are on `main` or `master` — if not, run `git checkout main` (or `master`, whichever exists)
3. Suggest a branch name based on the task (e.g. `feat/rate-limiting`)
4. Run `git checkout -b <branch> origin/<default-branch>` to create the feature branch from the latest remote default branch
5. Run `git pull` to ensure up-to-date

## Phase 1: Planning

Follow the planning workflow defined in @plan-workflow.md (skip Step 0 — Git Check was already done above). plan-workflow.md generates its own `$TIMESTAMP` for the plan path.

## Gate: User Approval

Present the plan and ask:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Plan ready at [plan path from Phase 1]. [N] tasks, [M] waves. Key decisions: [summary]. Risks: [summary]."
  Options: Approve (Recommended) | Revise | Cancel
```

Do NOT proceed without approval. If revisions: update plan, re-present.

## Phase 2: Development

Follow the development workflow defined in @dev-workflow.md using the plan path from Phase 1 (skip Step 0 — Git Check was already done above). dev-workflow.md generates its own timestamp for the dev report.

## Wrap Up

Ask user:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Development complete. Report written to [dev report path]. Ready to commit, push, and create a PR?"
  Options: Create PR (Recommended) | Commit & push only | Skip
```

If creating PR:
1. Stage changed files
2. Commit with conventional commit message based on task
3. Push branch
4. Create PR with plan summary as description. Derive `BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-')`; if `".claude/$BRANCH/.cdt-issue"` exists and is non-empty, read `ISSUE_NO="$(cat ".claude/$BRANCH/.cdt-issue")"`; validate ISSUE_NO is numeric (digits only), then include `Closes #$ISSUE_NO` in the PR body.
5. After PR creation, if `".claude/$BRANCH/.cdt-scripts-path"` exists, move the issue to "In Review":
   `"$(cat ".claude/$BRANCH/.cdt-scripts-path")/sync-github-issue.sh" review`
6. Clean up branch state: `[ -n "$BRANCH" ] && rm -rf ".claude/$BRANCH"`

## Bridge

The plan file is the handoff (Lead carries the path between phases):
- Phase 1: architect teammate writes it (architecture, tasks, research)
- Phase 2 reads and updates it (status, logs, files)
- Lead's context spans both phases; teammate context does not
- Lead carries the plan path from Phase 1 → Phase 2

## Rules

- Never skip approval gate
- One team at a time — cleanup before next
- Plan is single source of truth
- Researcher is always a subagent
- All other roles are teammates
- Quality gates mandatory (test + review)
- If blocked — ask user
