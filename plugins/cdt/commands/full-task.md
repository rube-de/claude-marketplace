# /full-task — Complete Workflow

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS

Two-phase orchestration: plan team → user approval → dev team. One team per session, so plan team must be fully cleaned up before dev team starts.

```
Phase 1: plan-team               Phase 2: dev-team
┌──────────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────────┐
│  Lead (You)          │         │  Lead (You)               │
│  ├── architect  [tm] │ plan.md │  ├── developer   [tm]     │
│  ├── prod-mgr   [tm] │──────→ │  ├── code-tester [tm]     │
│  └── researcher [sa] │         │  ├── qa-tester   [tm]     │
└──────────────────────┘         │  ├── reviewer    [tm]     │
                ▲                │  └── researcher  [sa]     │
         User Approval           └───────────────────────────┘
```

`[tm]` = teammate (Agent Team)  `[sa]` = subagent

## Step 0: Git Check

1. Run `git fetch origin`
2. Ensure you are on `main` or `master` — if not, run `git checkout main` (or `master`, whichever exists)
3. Suggest a branch name based on the task (e.g. `feat/rate-limiting`)
4. Run `git checkout -b <branch> origin/<default-branch>` to create the feature branch from the latest remote default branch
5. Run `git pull` to ensure up-to-date

## Phase 1: Planning

Follow the planning workflow defined in @plan-task.md (skip Step 0 — Git Check was already done above). plan-task.md generates its own `$TIMESTAMP` for the plan path.

## Gate: User Approval

Present the plan and ask:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Plan ready at [plan path from Phase 1]. [N] tasks, [M] waves. Key decisions: [summary]. Risks: [summary]."
  Options: Approve (Recommended) | Revise | Cancel
```

Do NOT proceed without approval. If revisions: update plan, re-present.

## Phase 2: Development

Follow the development workflow defined in @dev-task.md using the plan path from Phase 1 (skip Step 0 — Git Check was already done above). dev-task.md generates its own timestamp for the dev report.

## Wrap Up

Ask user:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Development complete. Report written to [dev report path]. Ready to commit, push, and create a PR?"
  Options: Create PR (Recommended) | Commit & push only | Skip
```

If creating PR:
1. Stage changed files
2. Commit with conventional commit message based on task
3. Push branch
4. Create PR with plan summary as description

## Bridge

The plan file is the handoff (Lead carries the path between phases):
- Phase 1 writes it (architecture, tasks, research)
- Phase 2 reads and updates it (status, logs, files)
- Lead's context spans both phases; teammate context does not
- Lead carries the plan path from Phase 1 → Phase 2

## Rules

- Never skip approval gate
- One team at a time — cleanup before next
- Plan is single source of truth
- Researcher is always a subagent
- All other roles are teammates
- Quality gates mandatory (test + review)
- If blocked — ask user
