# Claude Dev Team

Multi-agent development workflow with four modes. Pick one based on the user's needs:

| Mode | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| **plan** | Need architecture/design before coding |
| **dev** | Have an approved plan, ready to implement |
| **full** | End-to-end with user approval gate between plan and dev |
| **auto** | End-to-end without approval gate |

Before executing any mode, read [references/WORKFLOW.md](references/WORKFLOW.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions, spawn prompts, and output templates.

## Architecture

```
Plan Phase (plan/full/auto)     Dev Phase (dev/full/auto)
  Lead (You)                      Lead (You)
  ├── architect  [teammate]       ├── developer    [teammate]
  ├── prod-mgr   [teammate]      ├── code-tester  [teammate]
  └── researcher [subagent]       ├── ux-tester    [teammate, conditional]
                                  ├── reviewer     [teammate]
                                  └── researcher   [subagent]
         │                                │
         └──── plan.md (handoff) ─────────┘
```

**Teammates** message each other directly (Architect teammate↔PM teammate, Developer teammate↔Code-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔UX-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔Reviewer teammate).
**Researcher** is a subagent — Lead relays results.

## Roles

### Researcher (subagent — spawn via Task without team_name)

Research specialist for doc lookups. Queries Context7 for library docs, searches web for best practices, returns structured findings with code examples. Bundled as `agents/researcher.md` in this plugin — Context7 MCP is auto-configured via `.mcp.json`.

### Architect (teammate — plan phase)

Designs architecture: components, interfaces, file changes, data flow, testing strategy. Debates tradeoffs with PM teammate. Messages design to lead and PM teammate.

### Product Manager (teammate — plan phase)

Validates architecture against requirements. Challenges design with concerns. Produces verdict: APPROVED or NEEDS_REVISION with specifics.

### Developer (teammate — dev phase)

Implements tasks from plan. No stubs, no TODOs. Matches existing patterns. Iterates with code-tester teammate on failures, ux-tester teammate on UX issues, reviewer teammate on code quality.

### Code-Tester (teammate — dev phase, always)

Unit/integration tests. Messages developer teammate with failures + root cause. Max 3 cycles.

### UX-Tester (teammate — dev phase, conditional)

Spawned only for UI/frontend tasks. Writes Storybook stories for new/changed components, then tests user flows via `npx agent-browser`. Messages developer teammate with UX issues + screenshot evidence. Max 3 cycles.

### Reviewer (teammate — dev phase)

Reviews changed files for completeness, correctness, security, quality, plan adherence. Validates review with `/council` (`quick quality` for routine, `review security` or `review architecture` for critical concerns). Scans for stubs. Messages developer teammate with file:line + fix suggestions. Max 3 cycles.

## Rules

- One team at a time — cleanup plan-team before starting dev-team
- Teammates debate directly (Architect teammate↔PM teammate, Developer teammate↔Code-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔UX-tester teammate (if spawned), Developer teammate↔Reviewer teammate)
- UX-tester is conditional — only spawn when the task involves UI, web pages, or user-facing changes
- Researcher is always a subagent — Lead relays results
- Plan.md is the single source of truth and handoff artifact
- Every task declares `depends_on`; parallel within waves, sequential between
- Verify build between waves
- Avoid file conflicts between parallel tasks
- Testing + review are mandatory quality gates
- Always cleanup team before finishing
- In dev/full/auto modes, use delegate mode (Shift+Tab) to keep the lead focused on coordination
- Plan mode: do NOT implement — only plan
- If stuck — ask user, don't loop
