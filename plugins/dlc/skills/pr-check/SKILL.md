# DLC: PR Review Compliance

Fetch PR review comments, implement fixes for unresolved items, and report compliance.

Before running, **read [../dlc/references/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md](../dlc/references/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md) now** for the issue format, and **read [../dlc/references/REPORT-FORMAT.md](../dlc/references/REPORT-FORMAT.md) now** for the findings data structure.

## Step 1: Resolve Target PR

Determine the PR to check:

```bash
# If PR number provided as argument
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json number,title,url,headRefName,state

# If no argument — detect from current branch
gh pr view --json number,title,url,headRefName,state
```

If no open PR is found, abort with: "No open PR found for the current branch. Push your changes and open a PR first."

## Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

Retrieve all review comments and categorize them:

```bash
# Get all review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --paginate

# Get review threads (to check resolved status)
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviewDecision,reviews,comments
```

Parse each comment into:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `author` | `.user.login` |
| `body` | `.body` |
| `path` | `.path` (file the comment is on) |
| `line` | `.line` or `.original_line` |
| `created_at` | `.created_at` |
| `in_reply_to` | `.in_reply_to_id` (null if top-level) |

## Step 3: Categorize Comments

Classify each top-level review thread:

| Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Resolved** | Thread explicitly marked as resolved in GitHub, or author replied confirming fix |
| **Dismissed** | Review was dismissed, or comment is a nit/optional suggestion (contains "nit:", "optional:", "consider:") |
| **Unresolved** | Active thread with no resolution — the reviewer expects a change |

For unresolved comments, further classify by actionability:

| Sub-Category | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| **Fixable** | Comment points to a specific code change (rename, refactor, add check, fix bug) |
| **Discussion** | Comment asks a question or raises a concern that needs human judgment |
| **Blocked** | Fix requires information or access the agent doesn't have |

## Step 4: Critically Evaluate and Implement Fixable Items

For each **fixable unresolved** comment, follow a three-phase workflow:

### 4a. Read Context

1. Read the file at the referenced path
2. Read at least 20 lines of surrounding context (before and after the target line)
3. Read the full comment thread (including any replies)

### 4b. Critically Evaluate

Assess the suggestion against these criteria:

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Technical correctness | Is the suggestion factually correct? |
| Project alignment | Does it match existing patterns in this codebase? |
| Regression risk | Could implementing it break other functionality? |
| Scope appropriateness | Is the change proportional to the problem? |

Assign a confidence level:
- **High**: All four criteria pass — the suggestion is clearly correct and safe
- **Medium**: One or two criteria are uncertain — the suggestion is plausible but not obvious
- **Low**: Multiple criteria fail or the suggestion appears technically incorrect

### 4c. Confidence-Gated Implementation

- **High confidence** → Implement directly using `Edit` or `Write`, then stage: `git add <file>`
- **Medium or Low confidence** → Use `AskUserQuestion` to present:
  - The quoted reviewer comment
  - Your assessment (which criteria passed/failed and why)
  - Options: "Implement as suggested" / "Skip this comment" / "Implement with modification"
  - If "Implement with modification" is chosen, ask for guidance before proceeding

**Guardrails:**
- Only modify files that are part of the PR's diff
- Do not make changes the reviewer didn't request
- If unsure about intent, classify as **Discussion** instead of guessing
- Never implement a suggestion assessed as technically incorrect without explicit user approval

## Step 5: Reply to Comments

For each addressed comment, post an inline reply:

```bash
# Reply to a review comment
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="Fixed: {brief description of what was changed}" \
  -f in_reply_to={comment_id}
```

For **Discussion** items, post:
```text
Flagged for human review — see PR check summary below.
```

For **Blocked** items, post:
```text
Flagged for human review — see PR check summary below.
```

## Step 6: User-Gated Issue Creation

If no Discussion or Blocked items remain after Step 4, **skip this step entirely**.

If out-of-scope items remain (Discussion, Blocked, or items the user chose to skip), use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

- Present the count and a brief summary of remaining items
- Options: "Yes, create follow-up issue" / "No, I'll handle manually" / "Show me details first"

If the user selects "Show me details first", display each remaining item with your assessment, then re-ask with the first two options.

**If the user approves issue creation**, proceed:

**Read [../dlc/references/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md](../dlc/references/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md) now** and format the issue body exactly as specified.

**Critical format rules** (reinforced here):
- Title: `[DLC] PR Review: {n} unresolved comments on PR #{number}`
- Label: `dlc-pr-check`
- Body must contain: Scan Metadata table, Findings Summary table (severity x count), Findings Detail grouped by severity, Recommended Actions

**Severity mapping** (reinforced here for defense-in-depth):

| Comment Category | Severity |
|-----------------|----------|
| Unresolved — Blocked | **High** |
| Unresolved — Discussion | **Medium** |
| Unresolved — Fixable (unfixed due to error) | **Medium** |
| Dismissed | **Info** |

**Additional section** — add after Findings Detail:

```markdown
## PR Comment Status

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Resolved | {n} |
| Fixed by DLC | {n} |
| Skipped (user decision) | {n} |
| Discussion (needs human) | {n} |
| Blocked | {n} |
| Dismissed | {n} |
| **Total** | **{n}** |
```

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
BODY_FILE="/tmp/dlc-issue-${TIMESTAMP}.md"

gh issue create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "[DLC] PR Review: {n} unresolved on PR #{number}" \
  --body-file "$BODY_FILE" \
  --label "dlc-pr-check"
```

If issue creation fails, save draft to `/tmp/dlc-draft-${TIMESTAMP}.md` and print the path.

**If the user declines**, skip issue creation and proceed to Step 7.

## Step 7: Commit and Report

If fixes were made:

```bash
git commit -m "fix: address PR review comments"
```

Print summary:

```text
PR review compliance check complete.
  - PR: #{number} ({title})
  - Total comments: {n}
  - Resolved: {n}, Fixed by DLC: {n}, Skipped (user decision): {n}, Discussion: {n}, Blocked: {n}, Dismissed: {n}
  - Follow-up issue: #{number} ({url})  [only if user approved creation]
```

If all comments are resolved or dismissed, skip issue creation and report: "All PR review comments addressed."
