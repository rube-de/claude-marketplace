# /plugin-dev:create — Plugin Scaffolding

Scaffold a new Claude Code plugin in the cc-skills marketplace.

## Step 1: Plugin Name

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and matches kebab-case (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`), use it as the plugin name.

Otherwise, ask the user:

```
AskUserQuestion: "What should the plugin be named? (kebab-case, e.g. my-plugin)"
```

Validate:
- Must match `^[a-z0-9-]+$`
- Must NOT already exist in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (check `plugins[].name`)
- Must NOT have an existing directory at `plugins/<name>/`

If invalid, explain why and ask again.

## Step 2: Category

Ask the user to pick a category from the marketplace schema enum:

```
AskUserQuestion: "Which category?"
Options: code-review, development, productivity, quality, automation, documentation, devops, utilities
```

## Step 3: Components

Ask the user which components to include (multi-select):

```
AskUserQuestion: "Which components does your plugin need?" (multiSelect: true)
Options:
- skills — SKILL.md definitions (triggers, allowed-tools)
- hooks — Pre/PostToolUse, SessionStart hooks
- commands — Slash commands (/plugin:command)
- agents — Agent/subagent definitions
```

At least one must be selected. If none selected, default to `skills`.

## Step 4: Create Directory Structure

Create the plugin directory with selected components:

```
plugins/<name>/
├── skills/<name>/SKILL.md    (if skills selected)
├── hooks/hooks.json           (if hooks selected)
├── hooks/placeholder.sh       (if hooks selected)
├── commands/                   (if commands selected — empty, user fills in)
├── agents/                     (if agents selected — empty, user fills in)
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

### Generated SKILL.md (if skills selected)

```markdown
---
name: <plugin-name>
description: "<one-line description — user should update>"
allowed-tools: [Read, Bash, Grep, Glob]
user-invocable: true
---

# <Plugin Name>

TODO: Describe what this skill does and when it triggers.
```

### Generated hooks.json (if hooks selected)

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "SessionStart",
      "command": "bash plugins/<name>/hooks/placeholder.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Generated placeholder.sh (if hooks selected)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# <name> plugin — SessionStart hook
# Replace this with your actual hook logic

set -e
echo "<name> plugin loaded."
exit 0
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x plugins/<name>/hooks/placeholder.sh`

### Generated README.md

```markdown
# <name>

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Claude Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude%20Code-Plugin-purple.svg)]()

TODO: Describe your plugin here.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install <name>@rube-cc-skills
```

## Usage

TODO: Document usage.

## License

MIT
```

### Generated LICENSE

Use the standard MIT license text with `Copyright (c) 2025 rube-de`.

## Step 5: Register in Marketplace

Read `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, add a new entry to the `plugins` array:

```json
{
  "name": "<name>",
  "description": "TODO: Update plugin description (min 10 chars)",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "source": "./plugins/<name>",
  "category": "<selected-category>",
  "author": {
    "name": "rube-de",
    "url": "https://github.com/rube-de"
  },
  "keywords": ["<name>"]
}
```

**Important**: Remind the user to update the `description` field — the placeholder won't pass schema validation (needs to be meaningful).

## Step 6: Validate

Run the validation script to confirm the new plugin passes all checks:

```bash
bun scripts/validate-plugins.mjs
```

If validation fails, diagnose and fix automatically if possible. Common issues:
- Description too short (< 10 chars) — ask user for a real description
- Name not kebab-case — should have been caught in Step 1

## Step 7: Update Root Documentation

After validation passes, update the three root documentation files to include the new plugin.

### A. CLAUDE.md — Add row to plugin table

Read `CLAUDE.md` and find the plugin table:

```markdown
| Plugin | Category | Skill Triggers |
|--------|----------|----------------|
...existing rows...
```

Add a new row at the end of the table:

```
| <name> | <Category> | `/<name>` |
```

If the plugin has commands (selected in Step 3), list those too. For example, if there is a command called `create`:

```
| <name> | <Category> | `/<name>`, `/<name>:create` |
```

Capitalize the category to match existing rows (e.g. `development` → `Development`, `code-review` → `Code Review`, `devops` → `DevOps`).

### B. README.md — Four updates

Read `README.md` and make these four changes:

#### 1. Plugin count badge

Find the badge line:

```
[![Plugins](https://img.shields.io/badge/plugins-N-green.svg)](#plugins)
```

Increment `N` by 1.

#### 2. Plugin table

Find the plugin table:

```markdown
| Plugin | Category | Install | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
...existing rows...
```

Add a new row at the end of the table:

```
| [<name>](./plugins/<name>/) | <Category> | <Install> | <description> |
```

- Use `Plugin only` if the plugin has hooks or commands (i.e. it can't work as a standalone skill)
- Use `Plugin or Skill` otherwise
- Use the description from marketplace.json (or the user-provided description)

#### 3. Install command lists

Find **every** `for p in council cdt ... ; do` loop in the file. There are multiple (install all, project-scoped install, update). Append `<name>` to the plugin list in each loop.

For example, change:

```
for p in council cdt project-manager plugin-dev temporal doppler oasis-dev; do
```

to:

```
for p in council cdt project-manager plugin-dev temporal doppler oasis-dev <name>; do
```

Also find the individual `claude plugin install` commands listed one per line and add:

```
claude plugin install <name>@rube-cc-skills
```

after the last existing entry.

#### 4. Directory structure tree

Find the directory tree in the `## Structure` section. Add the new plugin entry before the closing `├── scripts/` line, maintaining alphabetical order among plugins. For example:

```
│   ├── <name>/              # <Short description>
│   │   └── skills/          # <name> + references
```

If the plugin has additional components (hooks, commands, agents), include those subdirectories. Make sure the **last** plugin entry in the tree uses `└──` instead of `├──` for correct tree formatting.

### C. AGENTS.md — Two updates

Read `AGENTS.md` and make these two changes:

#### 1. Plugin count

Find the opening line:

```
Claude Code skills marketplace: **N plugins** for ...
```

Increment `N` by 1.

#### 2. Directory structure tree

Find the directory tree in the `## Directory Structure` section. Add the new plugin entry, maintaining alphabetical order among plugins. Follow the same pattern as existing entries:

```
│   ├── <name>/               ← <Short description>
│   │   └── skills/           # <name> + references
```

If the plugin has additional components, include those subdirectories. Make sure the **last** plugin entry uses `└──` with `←` arrow style, and all others use `├──`.

## Step 8: Summary

Present a summary of what was created:

```
✓ Created plugins/<name>/
  ├── skills/<name>/SKILL.md
  ├── hooks/hooks.json + placeholder.sh
  ├── README.md
  └── LICENSE
✓ Registered in .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
✓ Validation passed
✓ Updated CLAUDE.md plugin table
✓ Updated README.md (badge, table, install commands, directory tree)
✓ Updated AGENTS.md (plugin count, directory tree)

Next steps:
1. Edit SKILL.md to define your skill's triggers and behavior
2. Update README.md with documentation
3. Update the description in marketplace.json
4. Run: bun scripts/validate-plugins.mjs
```

## Important Notes

- Do NOT create a per-plugin `plugin.json` — marketplace.json is the SSoT
- If the user provides a description during scaffolding, use it in both SKILL.md and marketplace.json
