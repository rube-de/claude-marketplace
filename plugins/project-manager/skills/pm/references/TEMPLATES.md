# Agent-Optimized Issue Templates

These templates are designed for **LLM agent execution**. Every section is a contract — agents
parse headers to understand structure. Humans benefit from the clarity as a side effect.

## Formatting Rules

1. **`VERIFY:` prefix** — Acceptance criteria that agents must validate after implementation
2. **`AGENT-DECIDED:` tag** — Decisions made by the PM skill when user said "you decide"
3. **`NEEDS CLARIFICATION:` tag** — Gaps that must be resolved before an agent starts work
4. **File paths** — Always relative to repo root: `src/auth/login.ts`
5. **Step ordering** — Implementation steps are numbered and sequential
6. **Scope sections** — Always include both "In Scope" and "Out of Scope"

## Refactor

```markdown
## Context

**Why refactor:** [tech debt / performance / extensibility / pattern alignment]

[1-2 paragraphs: what's wrong with the current state and why it matters now.
Include specific pain points — "this file is 800 lines" or "adding a new handler
requires changes in 5 places".]

## Current State

[Describe the current code structure, patterns, or architecture being refactored.
Be specific — reference files, functions, patterns.]

```
Current structure:
src/handlers/
├── user-handler.ts      (400 lines, mixed concerns)
├── auth-handler.ts      (300 lines, duplicated validation)
└── utils.ts             (catch-all, 600 lines)
```

## Desired State

[Describe the target structure, patterns, or architecture.]

```
Target structure:
src/handlers/
├── user/
│   ├── handler.ts       (route handling only)
│   ├── validation.ts    (input validation)
│   └── service.ts       (business logic)
├── auth/
│   ├── handler.ts
│   ├── validation.ts
│   └── service.ts
└── shared/
    ├── validation.ts    (shared validators)
    └── errors.ts        (error types)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] VERIFY: All existing tests pass without modification (behavior preserved)
- [ ] VERIFY: [Specific structural goal, e.g., "no file exceeds 200 lines"]
- [ ] VERIFY: [Pattern goal, e.g., "all handlers follow handler/validation/service pattern"]
- [ ] VERIFY: No public API changes (unless explicitly noted)
- [ ] VERIFY: [Performance target if applicable]

## Implementation Guide

### Files to Modify
- `src/path/to/file.ts` — [what changes]

### Files to Create
- `src/path/to/new-file.ts` — [extracted from where, purpose]

### Files to Delete
- `src/path/to/old-file.ts` — [replaced by what]

### Approach
1. [Step 1: Add tests for current behavior if missing]
2. [Step 2: Create new structure]
3. [Step 3: Move logic incrementally]
4. [Step 4: Update imports]
5. [Step 5: Verify all tests pass]
6. [Step 6: Remove old files]

### Constraints
- **Must preserve:** [list of behaviors/APIs that must not change]
- **Performance:** [must not regress beyond X]
- **Incremental:** [can this be done in stages? if so, what stages]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [Specific files/modules being refactored]

### Out of Scope
- [Functional changes — this is structure only]
- [Performance optimization — separate issue]
- [Files not in the target area]

## Risk Assessment

- **Blast radius:** [what could break — list downstream consumers]
- **Rollback plan:** [how to revert if something goes wrong]
- **Testing gaps:** [areas with insufficient test coverage]

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: #N (if applicable)
- Blocks: #N (features waiting on this refactor)
```
