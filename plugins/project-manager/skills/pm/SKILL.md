# Project Manager

GitHub issue lifecycle: **create**, **triage**, **audit**, and **review**.

## Sub-Skills

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Create | `/pm` or `/pm -quick <desc>` | Create structured issues optimized for agent execution |
| Next | `/pm:next` | Triage open issues — recommend what to work on next |
| Update | `/pm:update` | Audit open issues — find stale, orphaned, and drift |
| Review | `/pm:review ISSUE_NUMBER` | Deep-validate a single issue against the codebase |

## Usage

```text
/pm                       → Create a new issue (interactive flow)
/pm -quick fix the login  → Create issue with smart defaults
/pm next                  → Triage: recommend next issue to work on
/pm:next                  → Same (alternate syntax)
/pm update                → Audit: find stale/orphaned issues
/pm:update                → Same (alternate syntax)
/pm review 42             → Review: validate issue #42 against codebase
/pm:review 42             → Same (alternate syntax)
```

## Routing

Parse the first argument:

| Argument | Route to |
|----------|----------|
| `next` | `/pm:next` sub-skill |
| `update` | `/pm:update` sub-skill |
| `review` | `/pm:review` sub-skill |
| `-quick [desc]` | Create Issue Workflow (quick mode) below |
| anything else / empty | Create Issue Workflow below |

If routed to a sub-skill, invoke it with `Skill` and pass remaining arguments. Otherwise, continue with the Create Issue Workflow below.

## Create Issue Workflow

Create structured GitHub issues optimized for **LLM agent execution first, human readability second**.

Every issue produced by this skill follows the Agent-Optimized Issue Format — structured sections
with consistent headers, machine-parseable acceptance criteria, explicit file paths, verification
methods, and clear scope boundaries.

### Activation

This skill activates when users want to create work items for an agent team. Recognize these signals:

| Signal | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Direct | "create an issue", "write a ticket", "plan this work" |
| Implicit | "we need to fix...", "let's add...", "can we refactor..." |
| Shorthand | "/pm", "project manager", "create task" |

### Arguments

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-quick` | Quick mode — propose smart defaults instead of blocking on ambiguity |

**Usage:** `/pm -quick add a delete button to user profiles`

Parse the first argument for `-quick`. If present, activate quick mode. Everything after the flag is the task description.

### Core Workflow

```text
1. Classify → 2. Discover → 3. Challenge → 4. Explore Codebase → 5. Draft → 6. Review → 7. Create
```

#### Step 1: Classify Issue Type

Use `AskUserQuestion` to determine the issue type:

```text
Question: "What type of work is this?"
Options:
  - Bug: Something is broken or behaving incorrectly
  - Feature: New functionality or enhancement to existing behavior
  - Epic: Large initiative requiring 3+ coordinated tasks
  - Refactor: Improve code structure without changing behavior
  - New Project: Build something from scratch (includes tech stack decisions)
  - Chore/Research: Maintenance, dependency updates, spikes, investigations
```

If the user's initial message already makes the type obvious (e.g., "there's a crash when..."),
skip this step and classify automatically. State your classification and proceed.

#### Step 2: Type-Specific Discovery

Run the question flow for the classified type. See [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md).

**Key principles:**
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for structured choices (max 4 questions per call, 2-4 options each)
- Use follow-up conversation for open-ended details
- Batch related questions together to minimize round-trips
- If user says "you decide" or similar, make a reasonable choice and note it as `[AGENT-DECIDED: rationale]`
- Mark gaps as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]` — don't guess on ambiguous requirements
- **Never accept vague requirements.** Before moving to the next step, critically examine every
  requirement for specificity. If a user says "add a button", ask: Where? What states? What action?
  If a user says "fix the bug", ask: What exact behavior? What's expected vs actual? What triggers it?
  Treat every underspecified detail as a blocker.

#### Step 3: Requirements Challenge

After discovery, systematically check for underspecified requirements. See the
**Requirements Challenge Checklist** in [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md)
for the full dimension list.

**Default mode (critical):**
1. Analyze gathered requirements against the challenge checklist dimensions
2. Identify every gap — placement, states, behavior, edge cases, error handling, accessibility
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` to probe each gap (batch related questions, max 4 per call)
4. Do NOT proceed to codebase exploration until all critical ambiguities are resolved
5. An agent executing the resulting issue should never need to guess intent

**Quick mode (`-quick`):**
1. Analyze gathered requirements against the same checklist dimensions
2. For each gap, propose a smart default with rationale
3. Present all assumptions in a single summary: "Here's what I'll assume: [list]. Confirm or correct?"
4. Proceed after one confirmation round — only block on truly ambiguous requirements where no
   reasonable default exists
5. Tag every assumed detail in the final issue body with `[AGENT-DECIDED: rationale]`

**Example — "add a delete button to user profiles":**

*Critical mode:*
> I need to clarify several details before drafting:
> - Where on the profile page should the button go? (header actions, settings section, footer)
> - Who can see it? (all users, admins only, own profile only)
> - What happens on click? (immediate delete, confirmation dialog, soft delete)
> - What are the visual states? (default, hover, disabled, loading)
> - What about error handling? (network failure, permission denied)

*Quick mode (`-quick`):*
> Here's what I'll assume — confirm or correct:
> - Placement: profile header action bar, right-aligned
> - Visibility: own profile only, admins on any profile
> - On click: confirmation dialog → soft delete → redirect to home
> - States: default (red outline), hover (red fill), loading (spinner), disabled (greyed, no permission)
> - Errors: toast notification with retry option

#### Step 4: Codebase Exploration

Before drafting, explore the codebase to enrich the issue with concrete details:

- **Find relevant files**: Use `Glob` and `Grep` to identify files that will need modification
- **Understand current patterns**: Read existing code to align implementation hints with actual architecture
- **Check for related work**: Search for TODOs, existing tests, related components
- **Verify assumptions**: Confirm that proposed changes don't conflict with existing code

This step is critical — agents executing the issue will perform better with accurate file paths
and pattern-aware implementation hints.

#### Step 5: Draft the Issue

Use the appropriate template from [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

**Agent-first formatting rules:**

1. **Sections are contracts** — every section header means something. Agents parse them.
2. **Acceptance criteria are tests** — write them as verifiable assertions: `VERIFY: [condition]`
3. **File paths are absolute from repo root** — `src/auth/login.ts`, not "the login file"
4. **Approach is sequential** — numbered steps an agent follows linearly
5. **Scope is explicit** — "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" prevent agents from over-engineering
6. **Dependencies are linked** — `Blocked by: #N` and `Blocks: #N`
7. **Constraints are non-negotiable** — performance targets, backwards compatibility, etc.

Write the draft to a temp file: `/tmp/issue-body.md`

#### Step 6: Review

Present the draft to the user with a summary:
- Title
- Type and labels
- Key acceptance criteria
- File scope

Ask: "Ready to create this issue, or want to adjust anything?"

For epics: also present the sub-issue breakdown before creating.

#### Step 7: Create

```bash
gh issue create --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --title "<type-prefix>: <description>" \
  --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md \
  --label "<type-label>"
```

**Title prefixes by type:**
| Type | Prefix | Label |
|------|--------|-------|
| Bug | `fix:` | `bug` |
| Feature | `feat:` | `enhancement` |
| Epic | `epic:` | `epic` |
| Refactor | `refactor:` | `refactor` |
| New Project | `project:` | `project` |
| Chore | `chore:` | `chore` |
| Research | `spike:` | `research` |

**On failure:** Save draft to `/tmp/issue-draft-{timestamp}.md`, report error.

For epics: create the parent issue first, then sub-issues with `Part of #EPIC_NUMBER` references.

Report all created issue URLs to the user.

### Quality Checklist

Before creating any issue, verify:

- [ ] Title is concise and action-oriented (imperative mood)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable — not vague ("improve performance" → "response time < 200ms")
- [ ] Implementation hints reference real files found via codebase exploration
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (In/Out of Scope sections)
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and linked
- [ ] No external context required — issue is self-contained
- [ ] Uncertainty is marked with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]`
- [ ] Agent-decided items are marked with `[AGENT-DECIDED: rationale]`

### Duplicate Check

Before creating, always search for existing issues:

```bash
gh issue list --search "keywords" --state all --limit 10
```

If similar issue exists → inform user, suggest linking instead of duplicating.

### Repo Detection

Detect the current repo automatically:

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
```

If not in a git repo or no remote → ask user for the target repo.
